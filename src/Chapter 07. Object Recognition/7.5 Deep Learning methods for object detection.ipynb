    "# 7.5 Deep Learning methods for object detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks we have developed different **Machine Learning** (ML) algorithms for classifying images containing objects according to high-level features (shape, color, texture, etc.). In a nutshell, these methods use a number of representatitive images to train a classifier, which is composed by a set of parameters. Once trained, the model can be used to infer the category of objects appearing in new images not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may now, in the recent years there is an explosion of **Deep Learning** (DL) techniques that are achieving a high performance in different tasks. Indeed, DL models are a subgroup of ML with the peculiarity of having thousands, millions of parameters. This is achieved by using multiple layers, each one consisting of a given number of parameters, hence the *deep* of DL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of ML or DL techniques strongly depend on the application at hand. On the one hand, if there is available a large amount of data to train the model and the target platform where the model will run is powerful enough, then DL techniques are a good option. On the other hand, when data or computational resources' constrains exist, ML methods stands out. Moreover, while ML works with explainable high-level features and processes, DL employs low-level features and are considered black boxes with an input (e.g. an image) and an ouput (e.g. a set of detected objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "As commented, untill now we have been working with ML models. Let's take a look at DL ones!"

    "This time we will focus on mobile robots operaing in human-centered environments, for example houses. In order to provide services, a mobile robot must be able to understand its surroundings, including the elements in its workspace. For that object detection is a critital task since it permits the robot to locate objects that can be useful in its duties. Fig 1 provides some examples of objects detected in images coming from a comera mounted on a mobile robot:\n",

    "Fusing these detections with additional information like the robot pose within the workspace and the relative pose of the camera w.r.t., the objects can be localized in said workspace. For example, Fig. 2 shows the reconstruction of two houses where the robot has detected and placed a number of objects.\n",

    "## 7.5.1 Preparing the DL model\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of training a DL model is highly time and resources consuming, typically demanding a cluster of GPUs and huge datasets. Luckily for us, there is a bunch of already trained models freely available that we can use. And what is more, our lovely OpenCV incorporates the **DNN module** (Deep Neural Network), with permits us to run **DL inference**, that is, to feed a network with an image and get the results of its processing. This is quite interesting since we don't need to install other heavy frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffe or Keras often used to deal with these models. Moreover, it's not necessary to have a powerful GPU to make inference since OpenCV DNN is highly optimized to run in CPU. Good news everywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our problem is object detection, we will make use of a network trained for that aim. Concretely wee need two resources:\n",
    "- a file containing the configuration of the model to be used, and\n",
    "- another file with the weights (parameters) of said network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the dataset used to train the network, the categories that it would be able to detect differ. In this notebook we are going to employ a popular network trained with data from [Micrososf COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home). This is the most used dataset for dealing with object detection related-tasks and considers 80 different categories:\n",

    "The COCO dataset has a very nice webpage with many resources, including an explorer where you can see examples like the previous one. We encorage you to take a look at it! Having choosen the network and knowing the dataset it was trained with, its time to load the needed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading a file containing the names of the categories from COCO. This is useful since the network will provide the detected objects as numbers related to the indices that the categories has in this file. The following code reads this file and also builds a numpy array that assigns to each category a random color (used for results visualization)."
