    "In computer vision, a homography is usually defined as a **perspective transformation of a plane**, in other workds, a reprojection of a plane from one camera image into a different one, where the camera may have been translated and/or rotated. As a consequence, **any two images of the same planar surface in space are related by a homography**. This has many practical applications, such as image rectification, image registration, augmented reality, etc. \n",

Actually, this would be the next step for **image stitching** after computing matches with keypoints in the example application in Chapter 4. We have already the correspondences either using Harris or SIFT, so the homography should be easy to obtain.$\\\\[5pt]$\n",
